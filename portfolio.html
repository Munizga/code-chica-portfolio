    <h2>My Portfolio</h2>
    <h6>I have been interested in engineering since the 6th grade. 
        When we were tasked in finding a project to do for our school science fair, I chose to build a hovercraft and test the friction levels of different surfaces. 
        I had so much fun, I immediately started looking into colleges that offered engineering classes!
    <br>
    <br>

        In order to get into the college I wanted, my parents encouraged me to get my name out in the world.
        This meant entering in engineering competitions as well as volunteering for camps. 
        Every summer for the past four years, I would volunteer at my school's robotics camp for a week. 
        I would teach kids how to use either Lego Mindstorm or the Lego WeDo 2.0
        I was so taken with the idea of engineering that I would talk to my friends about it everyday.
        One day, my engineering teacher overheard and she suggested I enter in the Chevron Design Challenge. 
        I entered with some of my friends who knew how to 3D model using Inventor, and we went on a trip to the cometition.
        We didn't win, but my teacher kept pushing me to enter in competitions. 
        Because of both her and my parents pushing me to enter the world of engineering despite the difficulties of being a girl, I was able to push through the boundaries and win many awards.
